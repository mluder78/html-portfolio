<h1>The Best Movies According to Mandy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Almost Famous</h3>
<p>I love this movie because I like Kate Hudson's character Penny.  She has a very fun, free spirited aura bout her.  It is set in the 1970's where a young reporter follows a band and their groupies.  It is a fun movie to watch.</p>
<h3>Dazed and Confused</h3>
<p>This is a fun movie chronicaling the last day of school for Teenagers and the party that they go to afterwards.</p>
<h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>This movie is about some highschool students that have gotten themselves into trouble.  They are stuck on a Saturday in detention.  They end up learning that they might have more incommon than they realize.</p>
